<h3 id="job-experience">Job Experience</h3>

<p><strong>BONC, Beijing</strong> : <em>Software Engineer</em> <strong>Since 2013</strong> <br>
  During this period is engaged in a distributed analytical column store database system, which use HDFS from apache hadoop as the storage service to implement structured big amount of data’s storage and SQL query. <br>
  My tasks involve: HDFS investigation and modification; system main process’s memory pool, thread pool and such low level resource management modules; distributed primitives such as distributed lock implemented by zookeeper; hash join implementation of big tables which can not be fully loaded to RAM; JDBC driver development and partially maintenance of J2EE client. Besides of those, I also did some peripheral jobs such as project’s building system, deploy/debug tools and bug locating/log analysis tools.</p>

<p><strong>Neusoft, Shenyang</strong> : <em>Software Engineer</em> <strong>2010-2013</strong> <br>
  During this period I was mostly engaged in windows desktop C++ application development, which involved: self-implemented event-loop and widget painting without any standard or customized widgets to satisfy client’s various highly customized interface requirements; familiar with Japan’s EPG(Electronic Program Guide) specification, and implemented a high performance EPG stream parser; implemented device broadcast/discovery in LAN based on UPnP protocol and etc. <br>
  In the spare time I developed several small web applications, which employ frameworks such as J2EE, Ruby on Rails and node.js(Express.js). From frontend technologies such as js template and browser compatibility, to backend technologies like servlet framework and nginx/apache configuration and load balance, all are involved. <br>
  I also build up sufficient knowledge of linux system administration, small scale linux desktop application development with POSIX and boost during this period.</p>
